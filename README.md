This "Text Adventure Engine" is an old project that I rediscovered recently after learning much more about data structures.

I hope to soon work to upgrade this into a much more efficient algorithm.

In the project's current state, it is capable of constructing new rooms within the code and using conditionals to allow navigation between rooms. There is additional functionality for items and monsters in a room.
